## Indie Games

### Astral Ascent

##### Thursday, March 23, 2023

#### Overview

- Although still in Open Beta Astral Ascent is a 2D Pixel Art Rogue-lite game that captured my heart and attention with a gorgeous artstyle and fantastic ambiance. The main story of the game centers around 4 main Characters, Alya, Kiren, Octave, and Calie with one more to be announced upon official release (most likely DLC content).
- In Astral Ascent your home base, or what the characters would call their prison, is also called "The Garden" which is guarded by the 12 Zodiacs. As you make your Ascent you will go through four different zones before facing a final boss (unreleased). At the end of each of these four zones you will be faced by one of three possible Zodiacs chosen to guard that specific biome.
- Alaya, the Assassin: Since she can remember Alaya has lived in the Garden, it is where she trains, fights, eats, sleeps, and plays. However, Alaya's dreams lies beyond the Garden towards the world outside
- Kiren, the Brawler?: Not sure haven't explored his story much yet but seems that he has lived in the Garden since a young age as well
- Octave, the Gunslinger: Driven by a desire for revenge Octave has entered the Garden of his own free will to finally learn the truth about what happened to his mother, why she was betrayed, and who she was betrayed by as to finally get vengence fo the wrongs down to her.
- Calie, the Engineer: Just unlocked

#### Pros

- The brilliance of the pixel art used in this game simpiliy cannot be understated. In addition to being given the choice of outline vs no outline.
- Solid gameplay loop for a rogue-lite and facing one of three bosses prevents concecutive runs from feeling stagnent
- Double Jump resets on basic attack has to be one of my favorite mechanics
- Four distinct playable characters each with different playstyles and on top of that each characters builds can embody many different playstyles. This formula also lends well to adding to the game in the future
- Having spells rotate to add build variety was very smart, also like the addition of levels to upgrade basic attack and signature so that all other resources can go to skills, auras, and gambits if not stat boosts
- Wavedashing and dash cancel
- Incredibly fluid controls
- Updates are coming
- Still many more skills, auras, skins, and achievements to unlock, story is ok not the best but am curious to see who this jailor/ master is
- ART ART ART ART ART (not even just the Pixel Art)

#### Cons

- New updates will slow to a halt as they prep for full release, most likely won't be many new skills
- Next character most likely a paid DLC
- Might be too easy? Now this is only my first playthrough and I have only gotten past the second boss once. However, once I blew through the second boss the third boss fell just as easily. This fear is compounded by the fact that of the three possible bosses you can face in the first biome Taurus took me two tries to beat, Capricorn took me one, and Virgo took me three. Though this isn't horrible as it is the first boss I didn't really have too hard of a time with any of them.
- Basic attacks do almost nothing late- could be build issue?
- Still some bugs due to being in Early Access

#### Verdict: 6/10

- This may seem low but this is my score as of the early access release, there are still many things to fix and much room for improvement
- However, if the team improves on what they have talked about and if the later game bosses are tougher or as tough as Aquarius then I can definitly see this score shooting up to an 8/10 or 9/10
- However for me personally a 10/10 might be out of reach, the only Rogue-lite game that can achieve a score that high has got to be Hades by Supergiant games. Though many of the aspects from Hades that I love are here, and maybe this is due to the game's early access state but I don't get the same level of Immersion that I did while playing Zagreus
- That is not to say that the combat falls behind Hades, in fact I absolutley love the combat and the controls. This is definitly a game I will keep playing a keep a close watch on as it nears final release. 
- I'll be back to give my thoughts on the final release and the DLC (that is if I get my 20hrs of playtime for my money's worth, which honestly I do not think will be hard as I have just hit 10 hrs and just unlocked a new hero.


### Hades

##### Monday, March 27, 2023

#### Overview

- Hades is a beautiful isometric roguelite set in one of my favorite time periods and mythologies, Ancient Greek
- The main character Zagreus is the son of Hades however since he was born he has never left the underworld
- For a mysterious reason Hades and all of the underworld are against Zagreus's escape, however the gods of olympus feel sympathy for their kin and bless Zagreus with skills and boons to continue his ascent and finally reach the world above
- As I actually quite enjoyed the story I will stay away from spoilers as much as I can

#### Pros

- Zagreus has access to 5 different weapons: swords, spears, shields, gauntlets, and guns, however build variety does not end there, each weapon has 4 different aspect 3 of which are able to be aquired after unlockining the weapons and beating the first boss of the game. The final aspect or the so called 'hidden aspect' has its own specfic set of conditions for you to be able to even view or unlock it.
- On top of this there are a variety of 'Daedelus Hammer' upgrades that you can find throughout your run (maximum of 2 per run) and will give you an upgrade specific to your weapon.
- In addition with the blessing I mentioned before you can upgrade your basic attack, special attack, cast & dash in addition to aquiring a variety of passive effects, many of these blessings can be upgraded using a pomograte (in a nice little call back to the story of Hades and Persephone). There are also some special cases, legendary boons can be found after aquiring some specfic boons, in addition to duo boons which can combine the abilities of two olympians. Finally there is Hermes, he appears rarely but has some of the best upgrades in the game (one of which can double your dash count from 2 to 4).
- One of the many things that drew me away from the Roguelike genre is the feeling of losing all progression on death. However Hades has a plethora of permanent upgrades, hence the name roguelite. There are mirror upgrades that can boost your health, damage, number of dashes and more along with some fun unlockables that can change how your main area looks or even add different types of rooms to your runs.
- On top of this each characters remembers the number of interations they've had with you in a way that makes it feel like you are growing a relationship with them as Zagreus. Full voice acting that added a whole new level to this. In addiiton to adding some more fun unlockables that can be gifted to you by the varied cast.
- Hidden Fist Aspect is so fire
- Runs amazing on M1 Mac (was able to work on a 2013 intel mac too however would need to drop quality for a higher frame rate)
- As a person that plays mainly controller I was able to achieve a win using the keyboard controls too, both control sets are very fluid and easy to swap between.

#### Cons

- Hades 2 isnt out yet
- More Weapons
- More Bosses
- More Boons
- I just want more Hades

#### Verdict: 10/10

- One of if not the best Indie gamees I have ever played, the combat is so smooth and fast you actually feel like a demigod. In addition to the variety of builds you can play with plus items that can increase your odds of finding a boon you need this game truly lets you go wild with your build and try as many combinations as you want. 
- The storyline was really good in my humble opinion, plus the whole greek mythology setting is very nostalgic for me. If you have ever read Percy Jackson then you know what I mean. 
- The bosses have some of the best and most creative attacks I have ever seen. In addition to some fun minibosses. This game can get quite frusterating I have actually only beaten it a handful of times and have yet to see the end credits roll. Writing this reviews has honestly made me feel like going back and completing this game as it is what made me fall in love with the Indie gaming genre.
  
   

## Hardware

### 8-Bit Do

##### Monday, March 27, 2023

#### Overview

- An amazing controller with the ability to bluetooth synce to almost any device as almost any device. Though I have only tried it so far on IOS devices I will update this if I attempt to connect to an Xbox. However the 8-Bit Do can be paired as any of 4 options, as the 8-Bit Do itself, as an Xbox Controller, as a Playstation controller, and as a Nintendo Switch controller.

#### Pros

- Using it on my M1 Mac it will read it as any of those 4 options
- Uses a rechargable battery that can be charged while in the controller using USB-C

#### Cons

- Can randomly disconnect
- Sometimes has a hard time pairing 
- Not 100% sure all 4 modes work right

#### Verdit: 8/10

- A very good controller that is help back by minor bugs (that may just be due to time)
- It suffers from being outdated but a version 2.0 has been released, however as mine still works (almost) perfectly I probably will not get one until my current one stops working. Or may just wait for 3.0 if that gets announced.
