## Indie Games

### Astral Ascent

#### Overview

- Although still in Open Beta Astral Ascent is a 2D Pixel Art Rogue-lite game that captured my heart and attention with a gorgeous artstyle and fantastic ambiance. The main story of the game centers around 4 main Characters, Alya, Kiren, Octave, and Calie with one more to be announced upon official release (most likely DLC content).
- In Astral Ascent your home base, or what the characters would call their prison, is also called "The Garden" which is guarded by the 12 Zodiacs. As you make your Ascent you will go through four different zones before facing a final boss. At the end of each of these four zones you will be faced by one of three possible Zodiacs chosen to guard that specific biome.

#### Pros

- The brilliance of the pixel art used in this game simpiliy cannot be understated. In addition to being given the choice of outline vs no outline.
- Solid gameplay loop for a rogue-lite and facing one of three bosses prevents concecutive runs from feeling stagnent
- Double Jump resets on basic attack has to be one of my favorite mechanics
- Four distinct playable characters each with different playstyles and on top of that each characters builds can embody many different playstyles. This formula also lends well to adding to the game in the future
- Having spells rotate to add build variety was very smart, also like the addition of levels to upgrade basic attack and signature so that all other resources can go to skills, auras, and gambits if not stat boosts
- Wavedashing and dash cancel
- Incredibly fluid controls
- Updates are coming
- Still many more skills, auras, skins, and achievements to unlock, story is ok not the best but am curious to see who this jailor/ master is
- ART ART ART ART ART (not even just the Pixel Art)

#### Cons

- New updates will slow to a halt as they prep for full release, most likely won't be many new skills
- Next character most likely a paid DLC
- Might be too easy? Now this is only my first playthrough and I have only gotten past the second boss once. However, once I blew through the second boss the third boss fell just as easily. This fear is compounded by the fact that of the three possible bosses you can face in the first biome Taurus took me two tries to beat, Capricorn took me one, and Virgo took me three. Though this isn't horrible as it is the first boss I didn't really have too hard of a time with any of them.
- Basic attacks do almost nothing late- could be build issue?
- Still some bugs due to being in Early Access
