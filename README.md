## Indie Games

### Astral Ascent

##### Thursday, March 23, 2023

#### Overview

- Although still in Open Beta Astral Ascent is a 2D Pixel Art Rogue-lite game that captured my heart and attention with a gorgeous artstyle and fantastic ambiance. The main story of the game centers around 4 main Characters, Alya, Kiren, Octave, and Calie with one more to be announced upon official release (most likely DLC content).
- In Astral Ascent your home base, or what the characters would call their prison, is also called "The Garden" which is guarded by the 12 Zodiacs. As you make your Ascent you will go through four different zones before facing a final boss (unreleased). At the end of each of these four zones you will be faced by one of three possible Zodiacs chosen to guard that specific biome.
- Alaya, the Assassin: Since she can remember Alaya has lived in the Garden, it is where she trains, fights, eats, sleeps, and plays. However, Alaya's dreams lies beyond the Garden towards the world outside
- Kiren, the Brawler?: Not sure haven't explored his story much yet but seems that he has lived in the Garden since a young age as well
- Octave, the Gunslinger: Driven by a desire for revenge Octave has entered the Garden of his own free will to finally learn the truth about what happened to his mother, why she was betrayed, and who she was betrayed by as to finally get vengence fo the wrongs down to her.
- Calie, the Engineer: Just unlocked

#### Pros

- The brilliance of the pixel art used in this game simpiliy cannot be understated. In addition to being given the choice of outline vs no outline.
- Solid gameplay loop for a rogue-lite and facing one of three bosses prevents concecutive runs from feeling stagnent
- Double Jump resets on basic attack has to be one of my favorite mechanics
- Four distinct playable characters each with different playstyles and on top of that each characters builds can embody many different playstyles. This formula also lends well to adding to the game in the future
- Having spells rotate to add build variety was very smart, also like the addition of levels to upgrade basic attack and signature so that all other resources can go to skills, auras, and gambits if not stat boosts
- Wavedashing and dash cancel
- Incredibly fluid controls
- Updates are coming
- Still many more skills, auras, skins, and achievements to unlock, story is ok not the best but am curious to see who this jailor/ master is
- ART ART ART ART ART (not even just the Pixel Art)

#### Cons

- New updates will slow to a halt as they prep for full release, most likely won't be many new skills
- Next character most likely a paid DLC
- Might be too easy? Now this is only my first playthrough and I have only gotten past the second boss once. However, once I blew through the second boss the third boss fell just as easily. This fear is compounded by the fact that of the three possible bosses you can face in the first biome Taurus took me two tries to beat, Capricorn took me one, and Virgo took me three. Though this isn't horrible as it is the first boss I didn't really have too hard of a time with any of them.
- Basic attacks do almost nothing late- could be build issue?
- Still some bugs due to being in Early Access

#### Verdict: 6/10

- This may seem low but this is my score as of the early access release, there are still many things to fix and much room for improvement
- However, if the team improves on what they have talked about and if the later game bosses are tougher or as tough as Aquarius then I can definitly see this score shooting up to an 8/10 or 9/10
- However for me personally a 10/10 might be out of reach, the only Rogue-lite game that can achieve a score that high has got to be Hades by Supergiant games. Though many of the aspects from Hades that I love are here, and maybe this is due to the game's early access state but I don't get the same level of Immersion that I did while playing Zagreus
- That is not to say that the combat falls behind Hades, in fact I absolutley love the combat and the controls. This is definitly a game I will keep playing a keep a close watch on as it nears final release. 
- I'll be back to give my thoughts on the final release and the DLC (that is if I get my 20hrs of playtime for my money's worth, which honestly I do not think will be hard as I have just hit 10 hrs and just unlocked a new hero.
